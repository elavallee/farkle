Monte Carlo simulations of the game Farkle

Farkle is a dice rolling game similar to Yahtzee. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle.
I got interested in the game because there are a few options in the play of the game that enable a possible strategy along with the random component of the dice. I wanted to model the game and see if I could devise an optimal strategy. I don't really know if I have found the optimal strategy, but I had fun working on this. Let me know if you find a better strategy!

The hardest part of developing the code was probably the scoring, but there are a number of variations out there, so if you play a different one, you will need to modify the scoring function. The variation I play has three one's scored as 300 points, some people play that as 1,000 points.
