Monte Carlo simulations of the game Farkle

Farkle is a dice rolling game similar to Yahtzee. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle.
I became interested in the game because it offers several options in gameplay that enable a possible strategy, along with the random component of the dice. I wanted to model the game and see if I could devise an optimal strategy. I'm not entirely sure if I have found the optimal strategy, but I did enjoy working on this. Please let me know if you find a better strategy.

The hardest part of developing the code was the scoring, but since there are several variations available, you will need to modify the scoring function if you choose to play a different one. The variation I play has three ones scored as 300 points; some people play that as 1,000 points.
